# Maze-Escape

My first attempt at game development was the most fun I had programming. Yeah, almost all the levels here have a few bugs and yeah it's pretty short but as someone who played video games since childhood it was a fascinating experience to say the least.

Covid-19 is the theme of this little game and itâ€™s a 2D platformer. I tried to make each level different so the results vary here.
